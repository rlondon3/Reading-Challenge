# Reading Challenge
### [https://alluring-bears.surge.sh/books](Reading Challenge) <br/>
A simple application envisioned for teachers to assign reading assignments via the NY Times Bestseller API. This application was built in ReactJS and uses the context API.
A 'fake' student database was built in order to access what would be student data if this site had a custom backend.
